## Project Summary
We want to create a web application that can clearly display the crime. Users can use the website to report incidents they have seen as well as locate areas with high crime rates. With the use of this website, we want to reduce crime and improve student safety at UIUC.

## Project Description
Since the `crime rate` of Champaign and Urbana is almost the highest in Illinois, and `UIUC students` are the main victims, we decide to develop a web application that can help students and faculty to query and report crime in a map. In the map, Users can intuitively see `what`, `when`, `where` the crime happens in UIUC. 

Based on the `data and artificial intelligence`, the web can also predict where crime is most likely to occur, so that it can tell the police to raise the level of vigilance in that area, and also helps the public to avoid that area as much as possible. We hope both UIUC students and policemen can not only `survive` but also `thrive` in Champaign and Urbana.
